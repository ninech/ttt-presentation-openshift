# Tech Talk Thursday - Openshift

This presentation uses [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Setup

Some reveal.js features, like external Markdown and speaker notes, require that presentations run from a local web server. The following instructions will set up such a server as well as all of the development tasks needed to make edits to the reveal.js source code.

1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (4.0.0 or later)

1. Clone the reveal.js repository
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the reveal.js folder
   ```sh
   $ cd reveal.js
   ```

1. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   $ npm install
   ```

1. Serve the presentation and monitor source files for changes
   ```sh
   $ npm start
   ```

1. Open <http://localhost:8000> to view your presentation

   You can change the port by using `npm start -- --port=8001`.


### Folder Structure
- **css/** Core styles without which the project does not function
- **js/** Like above but for JavaScript
- **plugin/** Components that have been developed as extensions to reveal.js
- **lib/** All other third party assets (JavaScript, CSS, fonts)
